                        website. These websites should have their own privacy
                        policies, which you should check. We do not accept any
                        responsibility or liability for their policies

                        This Privacy Policy will come into effect on February
                        20, 2021 (the "Effective Date"). Although most changes
                        are likely to be minor, we may change our privacy policy
                        from time to time, to reflect changes to the Website,
                        customer feedback and applicable law and in our sole
                        discretion. If we decide to change our privacy policy,
                        we will post those changes on this page so that you are
                        always aware of what information we collect, how we use

                        changes to the privacy policy. We will not make

                        We collect various kinds of information that you provide
                        to us as well as information we obtain from your use of
                        the Website. Some of the types of information that we
                        collect include:
                    </p>
                    <p>Personal Information</p>

                        Information associated with or used to identify or
                        contact a specific person. Personal Information
                        includes: (1) contact data (such as name, address,
                        postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and
                        employer); (2) financial information (such as credit

                        code); and (4) certain Usage Data (defined below), such
                        as IP address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain personal information, such as information about
                        personal health or racial or ethnic origins, is
                        characterized as sensitive ("Sensitive Personal
                        Information") and subject to stricter regulation than
                        other personal information. Before providing it to use,
                        we urge you to carefully consider whether to disclose
                        your Sensitive Personal Information to us. If you do
                        provide Sensitive Personal Information to us, you
                        consent to its use and disclosure for the purposes and
                        in the manner described in this privacy policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Usage Data</p>
                    <p>
                        Information about an individual's online activity that,
                        by itself, does not identify the individual, such as:
                    </p>
                    • technical information, including your browser type,
                    service provider, IP address, operating system and webpages
                    visited;
                    <br />
                    • information about what you've searched for and looked at
                    while using the Website; or
                    <br />
                    • metadata, which means information related to items you
                    made available through the Website, such as the date, time
                    or location that a shared photograph or video was taken or

                    <p>
                        Generally, we do not consider Usage Data as Personal
                        Information because Usage Data by itself usually does
                        not identify an individual. Personal Information and
                        Usage Data may be linked together. Different types of
                        information also may be linked together and, once
                        linked, may identify an individual person. Some Usage
                        Data may be Personal Information under applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>Location Data</p>
                    <p>
                        A category of Personal Information collected about the
                        location of a mobile device or computer, including:
                    </p>
                    • the location of the mobile device or computer used to
                    access the Website derived from GPS or WiFi use;
                    <br />
                    • the IP address of the mobile device or computer or
                    internet service used to access the Website; and; and
                    <br />
                    • other information made available by a user or others that
                    indicates the current or prior location of the user.
                    <br />
                    5. How We Collect Information
                    <p>
                        Whether we collect certain types of information and how
