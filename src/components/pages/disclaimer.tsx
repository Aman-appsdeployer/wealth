                    <p>
                        Investments carry unknown risks and uncertainties linked
                        to markets, as well as analysts’ expectations about
                        future events. They should not, therefore, be the sole
                        basis of investment decisions. There are risks
                        associated with investing in securities, stocks, bonds,
                        exchange traded funds, mutual funds, and money market
                        funds involve risk of loss. Loss of principal is
                        possible. Any investment opportunities’ past performance
                        does not guarantee future performance. Historical

                        not recommendatory. Keep in mind that while
                        diversification may help spread risk it does not assure
                        a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market.
                        There is always the potential of losing money when you
                        invest in securities, or other financial products.
                        Investors should consider their investment objectives
                        and risks carefully before investing. Investors should
                        be aware that system response, execution price, speed,
                        liquidity, market data, and account access times are
                        affected by many factors, including market volatility,
